# Unity_beginner_course
 
Based on directions and assets from the course, I created three different games:
- Glitch Garden - tower defence, similar to Plants vs zombies
- Block Breaker - as the name says, its variant of popular block breaker game
- Space shooter - variant of arcade-style games, destory enemies coming in waves to increase your score
